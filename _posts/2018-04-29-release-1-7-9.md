Tilix 1.7.9 is now available and includes some new features, leverages new capabilities that VTE 0.52 brings as well as fixes a number of issues. Highlights for this release include:

* Badges for all! As of VTE 0.52 a Tilix specific VTE patch for badge support is no longer required
* Support for new VTE 0.52 features (#1233)
* New shortcuts to quickly cycle through previous command prompts. Requires VTE be compiled with Tilix alternate screen patch (#1369)
* Profiles in preferences has been re-worked so dialog uses less vertical space
* New GtkD 3.8.2 used which fixes a segmentation fault when casting objects from a null object
* Unsafe paste dialog uses a scrollwindow now when more than 6 lines of text (#1386)
* A new token ${activeTerminalTitle} has been added to provide more flexibility for session titles
* Triggers and custom hyperlinks now support using the tilix tokens (#1316)
* Custom hyperlinks are loaded before the default hyperlinks so users can override default behavior

Thank you to everyone who contributed to this release.
